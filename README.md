Fix My Cat
==================

A [Sliding Tile Puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) that is a reaction against the internet community's obsession with cats

Why?
-----------
Given a day to create a game to showcase front end development skills (HTML, CSS, JS), my group of four came up with the Fix My Cat scenario.

Setup
------
Run from your command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/peoplespete/FixMyCat.git
cd FixMyCat
npm install
```
If the npm install will not run without errors try:
```
sudo npm install
```
If you do not have supervisor, [install supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor).
```
supervisor app
```
The app should now be running at localhost:3000

How To Use
-----------

1. Enter your name and select `Easy` as the difficulty. (After working on easy you'll understand why there is no hard.)
2. Click `Start Game`
3. After seeing what a fixed cat (pun intended) looks like, click `Shuffle` to mix up the cat
4. Click on a tile bordering the open space
5. Repeat step 4 until you win!
